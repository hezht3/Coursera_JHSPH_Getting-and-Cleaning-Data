The goal of this course: **Raw data -> Processing script -> tidy data** -> data analysis -> data communication

## Raw and Processed Data

### Definition of data
+ Data are values of **qualitative** or **quantitative** variables, belonging to a set of items.
+ **Variables**: A measurement or characteristic of an item.

### Raw versus processed data
#### Raw data
+ The original source of the data
+ Often hard to use for data analyses
+ Data analysis *includes* processing
+ Raw data may only need to be processed once
#### Processed data
+ Data that is ready for analysis
+ Processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming, etc.
+ There may be standards for processing
+ All steps should be recorded
